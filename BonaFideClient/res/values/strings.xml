    <string name="title_about_activity">About BonaFide Provider</string>
    <string name="about_question_1">1. What is it?</string>
    <string name="about_answer_1">\tBonaFide Provider is an application that helps you to detect whether your Mobile Network Provider performs traffic differentiation. Your mobile provider might artificially limits a performance of certain type of traffic. For example the bandwidth for VoIP applications might be limited, in order to make using VoIP in mobile networks impossible. This application allows you to run a series of measurement tests to discover whether traffic throttling schemes were applied along the path.</string>
    <string name="about_question_2">2. Who are we?</string>
    <string name="about_answer_2">\tBonaFide Provider is a part of a research project of Computer Networks and Distributed Systems(CNDS) research group at Jacobs University Bremen. The main goal of this project is to collect and analyze the data from different mobile operators around the world, in order to learn whether and to which extend traffic shaping schemes are deployed in mobile networks. So, if you want to make a contribution to our research, you can submit your measurement results to us.</string>
    <string name="about_question_3">3. How does it work?</string>
    <string name="about_answer_3">\tBonaFide establishes a connection with our measurement server and generates two separate data flows. The first flow sends packets that carry randomly generated data. The second flow has exactly the same characteristics like the first one, but it carries packets that implement protocol that you want to test. The significant difference in those two flows performances might indicate that some traffic shaping policies were applied by a mobile provider along the path.</string>
    <string name="about_question_4">4. How to use it?</string>
    <string name="about_answer_4">\tFirst you need to specify the number of tests to execute. The actual channel performance in mobile networks is not a constant value and might change significantly during the time, especially in low-speed networks like EDGE. So, a single test execution will not be enough to make a conclusion about the traffic shaping existence along the path. To tolerate those errors it\'s highly recommended to increase the number of tests to run to 7-10 times. But keep in mind that you\'ll also increase the amount of data being transmitted during the tests. The total amount of data depends on the mobile network type that you are using. For example for the low-speed networks like EDGE one test consumes ~1 MB of data. For more faster network types like HSPA approximately 4MB of data is consumed. The measurement results are stored on SD card inside the BonaFide folder.</string>
    <string name="about_question_5">5. How to interpret measurement results?</string>
    <string name="about_answer_5">\tTest execution result file contains four tables: Download and Upload performances for Random and Protocol flows. Each table represents estimated channel bandwidth in some direction(upload or download) for messages of a different sizes. The bandwidth estimated for the biggest message size corresponds to an actual bandwidth of the link.\n\tNow you can compare corresponding values for Random and Protocol flows. And if the estimated bandwidth for a Protocol flow is always significantly lower than for a Random flow, than your mobile operator does some traffic shaping for a tested protocol type.\n\tN.B. The test result file also provides an information about the signal strength and network state changes during the test execution time. If the signal strength changes from the very low value(0-5 asu) to very high values(25-30) or vice versa, or even worse - the network disconnections were observed, the obtained results can\'t be treated as reliable anymore.</string>

Stored informations are identified by the identification token, which is randomly generated when this application stores result for the first time. Your results are only accessible via this identification token, which is only known to you (every user has a different token). It is very difficult to guess this token and even if it would be guessed, there is no information about who you are (telephone number, e-mail address etc.).
