BonaFide
========

Bonafide is an application for measuring network performance and
quality experience on mobile networks. Bonafide measurement servers
are distributed over the globe. The mobile application can measure
protocol-specific and random data performance. With protocol-specific
approach one can see how the network performs while using a specific
protocol instead of measuring a simple random data exchange. This
allows one to measure if traffic is shaped based on
protocol. Furthermore, it also allows users of smartphones to
understand what their quality of experience for a specific activity
(web browsing, internet telephony, gaming, etc.)  type would be in a
particular location, while using a particular network.
